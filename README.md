# **FaceESP**

Hi Everyone! This is a project made using an ESP32 microcontroller and MicroPython to make a OpenCV project on a face login system. I have started working on this project since 24th November 2024. This project was made to help me understand microcontrollers and get a better understanding of Computer Science while improving my skills.

**Features**:
- Face recognition with an ESP32-S3 camera module.
- Modular components (OLED, SD card, GPIO buttons).
- Supports four modes:
  - **On/Off**: Long press to toggle power.
  - **Register**: Capture and register a new face.
  - **Cancel**: Exit registration mode.
  - **Clear**: Delete all registered faces.
